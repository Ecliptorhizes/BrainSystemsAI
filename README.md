# NeuroCompute (Computational Neuroscience & AI Simulation)

This repository is a **step-by-step computational neuroscience project** focused on simulating a **biologically inspired artificial brain** using software only (no electronics or hardware).

The goal is to build a **learning, adaptive neural system** from first principles starting simple and growing in complexity while maintaining clarity, correctness, and scientific grounding.

This project emphasizes:
- Understanding how learning emerges from connections
- Simulating neural activity and plasticity
- Building toward intelligent behavior incrementally

## Project Philosophy

This project is:

- A **simulation**, not real biological tissue
- Inspired by **neuroscience principles**
- Implemented using **software + mathematics**
- Not a consciousness claim
- Not medical or clinical software

The focus is on **learning, adaptation, and signal processing**, not human replication.

## Development Roadmap (Phased Approach)

Each phase builds on the previous one.  
Do **not** skip phases.

---

## Phase 1 — Artificial Neurons (Foundations)

**Goal:** Create the smallest possible working unit of a brain.

### What you build
- A digital neuron
- Inputs → weights → activation → output

### Concepts
- Weighted sums
- Activation functions
- Signal flow
